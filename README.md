# Week-3-4-Assignment-2
Assignment 2 of Week 3-4 of Java Bootcamp.

Please review and let me know what i should change, i considered working with switch cases but i wouldve needed to set a value for checking the cases because it cant check for boolean. So there are a few uses of if/else if/else in the code, if u could tell me a good way to make it shorter, id be happy to hear.
